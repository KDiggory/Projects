# Projects

This repo contains 3 projects AI have worked on in my spare time. 
1 - A program that calculates the area of a 2d shape or the volume of a 3d shape
2 - The classic game Rock paper scissors.
3 - A text based adventure game that was the first thing I tried that really stretched me. I used an online tutorial to help me with this.
